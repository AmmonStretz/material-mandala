# Mandala

This project was generated with [angular-cli](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.0-beta.28.3.

## Description

This is a little project I created, while I was sick and had nothing TODO.
So please forgive me, some lines of bad code ;)

The target of this Project was to randomly generate mandala graphics,
inspired by the user images of github.

They are generated in an canvas directive called MandalaDirective.

## TODOs

1. Make the code cleaner
2. Add functions to reload the generated image
3. Add functions to save the generated image
4. Make the edges of the elements smoother
   (could be some sort of blur)
5. Change the function for random generating

## Development server
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
